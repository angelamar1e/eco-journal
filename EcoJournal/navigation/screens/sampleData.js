            content: 'Organic farming is a method of agriculture that relies on techniques such as crop rotation, green manure, compost, and biological pest control. It avoids the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, which can have harmful effects on the environment. Organic farming can improve soil fertility, reduce pollution, and promote biodiversity.\n\nOrganic food is also believed to be healthier for consumers as it contains fewer pesticides and additives. Studies have shown that organic foods can have higher levels of certain nutrients, such as antioxidants. By choosing organic products, you are not only supporting your health but also contributing to a more sustainable agricultural system.\n\nAdopting organic farming practices can also have economic benefits for farmers. Organic products often fetch higher prices in the market, and the reduced need for synthetic inputs can lower production costs. This can lead to increased profitability and economic sustainability for small-scale farmers.',
